Implementation of ML Model for Image Classification

This internship project involves designing and implementing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for image classification tasks.

I have designed and implemented following CNN models: 
1. CIFAR-10 Model:
a. Dataset: CIFAR-10 (available on Google).
b. Description: The model has been trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and is able to predict the classes of images accurately, achieving a good accuracy score.

2. Food Classifier:
a. Dataset: Food dataset (available on Kaggle).
b. Description: The model is trained on a food dataset to classify images into their respective categories. While it performs well on some images, its overall accuracy is lower and it struggles with certain predictions. Work is ongoing to improve the model's accuracy and performance.

Additionally, I have utilized MobileNetV2, a widely-used image classification model. This model demonstrates high accuracy in predicting image classes.
